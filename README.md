# URLShortner

This project aims to develop a URL shortener service that allows users to convert long URLs into shorter, more manageable strings. These shortened URLs can then be easily shared and used in various contexts, such as social media posts, emails, or printed materials.

## Features

- URL Expiration: Implement an option for URLs to expire after a certain period, ensuring they don't point to outdated content.
- Click Tracking: Track the number of clicks on each shortened URL for analytics purposes.
- User Accounts: Implement user accounts to manage shortened URLs and access click tracking data. 
- Advanced Analytics: Provide detailed click tracking reports with user demographics and geographical data.
